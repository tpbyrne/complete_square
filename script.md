# Completing the Square


## Problem Statement

* So, say you're asked to solve this quadratic equation where the value of the quadratic function has been set to zero.

* In other words, you're asked to find a value or values for x, that satisfy the equation 

* These values are called the roots of the quadratic function.

* One approach is to try to find values by inspection

## Solve by Inspection

* If we assume that the quadratic has factors x plus alpha and x plus beta we can multiply these out, group terms and compare like terms with those of the given equation

* so we can see in our equation, alpha plus beta **equates** to 3 and alpha times beta **equates** to minus 1.

* If alpha times beta equals minus 1 then integer solutions would be minus 1 and plus 1 (or plus 1 and minus 1) but these solutions don't sum to 3 so there may not be integer solutions

* So we need another approach

## Geometric Interpretation

* If we only consider the terms in x, we can interpret these as areas of geometric shapes

* We will generalize the equation and use b as the coefficient of x

* We can factor out x and express the x terms as "x into x plus b"

* We can easily imagine this as a rectangle of sides x plus b and x

* The area of the rectangle is seen as just the original term x squared plus b times x

* Alternatively we can just represent x squared as a square of side x and b times x as a rectangle of sides b and x 

* The area of the two shapes added together is again x squared plus b times x

## Complete the square

* So, if we start with a rectangle representing x into x plus b,  we can slice it into parts and even if we re-arrange those parts the total area will be the same

* We have re-arranged the rectangle almost into a square of side "x + b over 2" but not quite

* To complete the large square we have to add a small square of side "b over 2"

## Rectangle as difference of two squares

* We saw that the large square is made up of the area of the rectangle plus the small square needed to complete the large square

* So the rectangle's area can be seen as the difference of the large and the small squares

* This allows us to make a very useful substitution when solving a quadratic


# Solving

* We factor out x here just to make the rectangular term clear

* We then substitute the rectangular term with the difference of two squares

* Now it's easy to collect terms and simplify the right hand side

* Now we can take the sq root of both sides 

* And finally we have an expression for x giving us two roots: "-3 **plus** 13 all over two" and  "-3 **minus** root 13 all over two"

## Checking

* To check results, we take one of the roots as a value for x and substitute this into the equation

* Expanding terms, collecting and simplifying we see that the equation is satisfied

* Plotting the function, we see the roots as the intercepts of the function with the x-axis
